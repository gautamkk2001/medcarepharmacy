It promotes bone health and reduces the risk of fractures in people with low calcium and vitamin D levels. It is used to treat bone diseases such as osteomalacia and osteoporosis, in which the bones become weak and brittle. How should I take Shelcal 500 Tablet? Take Shelcal 500 tablet through your mouth (orally) and swallow it whole with a full glass of water or milk. Do not cut, chew or crush the tablet or it may not provide the desired results. There is no best time to take a Shelcal 500 tablet. Take it at the same time everyday preferably with or after a meal. Take the dose as mentioned by your doctor in the prescription. Do not take more than the prescribed dose or you may experience severe side effects. How does Shelcal 500 Tablet work? Shelcal 500 works by increasing calcium and vitamin D levels in the body and strengthening the bones. It corrects calcium and Vitamin D deficiency in the body and reduces the risk of fractures especially in older men and postmenopausal women suffering from bone diseases like osteoporosis. I missed a dose. What should I do? If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If your next dose is due soon, skip the missed dose and continue with the next dose at the same time. Do not take two doses to compensate for the missed dose. I have taken too much. What should I do? If you have taken more than your prescribed dose you may experience severe side effects. Call your doctor immediately. What are the benefits of Shelcal 500 tablet? Calcium makes up a major part of the bones and is necessary for maintaining bone strength and normal functioning of muscles and nerves. Calcium cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained from the foods you eat. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium in the gut. In addition to sunlight exposure, vitamin D is also produced in the body as a result of the foods we eat. With age, calcium and vitamin D deficiencies become more common, resulting in weak and fragile bones prone to fractures. Shelcal 500 helps maintain the body’s calcium and vitamin D levels, thus promoting bone health. It is used to treat bone diseases such as osteomalacia, a condition in which bones become soft, weak and brittle. It can also be used in combination with other medicines to treat osteoporosis in the elderly and in postmenopausal women. When should I consult my doctor after starting Shelcal 500 Tablet? Your doctor will prescribe Shelcal 500 for a set period of time, after which your symptoms should improve and you should start feeling better. After completing the course, your doctor may ask you for a follow-up visit to ensure that your condition has improved. If you do not notice any improvement after the course has finished, or if you experience severe side effects, consult your doctor right away."

Each 5 ml of Polycrol Xpress Relief contains Magnesium hydroxide 100 mg, Aluminium Hydroxide Gel 5 g, Activated dimethicone 125 mg, Sorbitol (70%). Aluminum hydroxide and Magnesium hydroxide reacts with the stomach acid and form a salt and water. Thus, the pH in the stomach is increased and the acidity caused by the gastric HCl is decreased. Dimethicone in Polycrol mixed with silicon dioxide gives simethicone (activated dimethicone). Activated dimethicone gathers all the small bubbles trapped in the stomach and intestine and later on, helps in releasing them in the form of belching or farts. It prevents entrapment of gas in mucus. Sorbitol acts like a laxative. It softens the stools and eases the excretion through feces. Use of Polycrol Xpress Relief (Sugar free) Gel 450 ml: Polycrol Xpress relief is an antacid gel, neutralizes the acid content in the stomach and gives relief from the burning sensation in the stomach. It helps in neutralizing the stomach acids and eliminates the gas entrapped in the stomach and the intestine. Thus, it helps in reducing acidity and flatulence."

His alleged secret to longevity? Cutting out the white stuff - sugar, salt, and oil - from his diet. Eating sugar has long been linked to adverse health effects like teeth cavities, accelerated aging, obesity, and lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and blood pressure. Not all sugars are bad for you. Natural sugars found in fruits, milk, and vegetables are safe; the issue begins with added sugars, which manufacturers add to packaged products to improve the taste or shelf life. How much sugar intake is OK? Added sugars are practically present in everything we eat, from obvious culprits like chocolates, candies, cakes, cookies, and soft drinks to the unexpected ones like bread, soups, and ketchup. The World Health Organization recommends limiting total sugar intake in adults to 12 teaspoons (50g) of sugar per day. Reducing it further to 6 teaspoons (25g) may be even better for your health. (1). The National Institute of India (NIN) dietary guidelines recommend cutting down on sugar and unhealthy processed foods which contain only empty calories and no health benefits. (2). Ways to eliminate sugar from daily diet!!! (3). (4). Though it may be hard for most people to entirely cut out sugar from the diet, following 7 simple ways can help you minimize your intake. 1. Cut down on tea and coffee: A cup of tea with 2 teaspoons of sugar contains 40 calories and needs about 5 minutes of jogging to burn. It can quickly add up if people drink multiple cups. (5). To begin, cut your sugar intake in half and gradually transition to sugar-free hot drinks or sugar substitutes. 2. Breakfast is the key: If you eat cereal for breakfast, check for whole wheat or bran cereals with no 'added sugar'. Add sliced fruits like bananas or dry fruits instead of sugar. When adding milk, choose a toned or low-fat option. Yogurt with fresh fruits & nuts or scrambled egg with whole-wheat toast could also be a better option. Substitute jam, honey or chocolate with home-made chutneys. 3. Switch to healthier snack options. Start by cutting back on sweet snacks. If you have two biscuits, start by reducing to one or replacing with low sugar, high fiber biscuits or cookies. Swap salted nuts, chocolates or cookies for healthier snacks like puffed rice (murmure), papad, makhana, popcorn or steamed home-made items like idli or rice cakes. 4. Desserts are a big part of being Indian, 'sweetening mouth' after meals, and eating sweets for every happy occasion is ingrained in us from childhood. Change to healthier habits by replacing ghee-laden sugar-heavy desserts for fresh fruit or raisins. Instead of gifting sweets for festivals, go for packaged nuts or dates. (6). 5. Switch from fizzy drinks: A liter of cola contains almost 20 tsps or 100g of sugar and would add 320 calories to your body. Opt for homemade nimbu paani (lemon water), low-fat milk or natural fruit and vegetable smoothies instead. When you are craving a sugary drink, you are often dehydrated and a glass of plain water or buttermilk will work just as well.(Z) 6. Portion control. Cut down the sugar quantity while making sweets or baking cakes to half the amount required. You won't even notice but the amount of sugar consumed will reduce. Try to add spices such as ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg rather than sugar into your favorite recipes. (6). 7. Shop smart. When shopping at the supermarket, always read the ingredients to assess how much added sugar is in the product. Compare similar products in order to find those with less sugar, less trans fat, and smaller sizes. High-sugar foods contain more than or equal to 22.5g of sugar per 100g of product, while low-sugar foods contain less than 5g of sugar per 100g of product. (3). Harmful effects of added sugar and the way out: (8)(9). With global sugar consumption tripling in the last 50 years, several health issues have emerged. Sugar is a leading cause of tooth decay in both children and adults, and it has been linked to an increased risk of cavities and gum disease. Obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, fatty liver, and even cancer can result from eating too much added sugar. Sugar hastens aging by inhibiting collagen regeneration and turnover, which are features of youthful skin. Harmful effects of added sugar and the way out: (8) (9).

Obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, fatty liver, and even cancer can result from eating too much added sugar. Sugar hastens aging by inhibiting collagen regeneration and turnover, which are features of youthful skin. Sugar reacts with proteins and fats to form AGES, which impair collagen's ability to regenerate, hastening the aging process. (10). (11). Conclusion Be mindful of the health hazards linked with consuming excess added sugar. Modify your food and drink intake and exercise caution while purchasing packed foodstuff. Remember to check the ingredients for sugar levels. Make smart choices to live a healthier and sweeter life!!!

      "intro": " Immunity is defined as the ability of the human body to recognize, neutralize or destroy harmful foreign micro-organisms such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi that can cause infections. The Immune System is a complex network of cells, tissues and chemicals that fight against infections and kill micro-organisms when the latter invades the human body. This system is basically composed of White Blood Cells which are produced in the Bone Marrow. They are concentrated in the bloodstream, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract and other glands and organs within the human body.

      "full": "What is Immunity? Immunity is defined as the ability of the human body to recognize, neutralize or destroy harmful foreign micro-organisms such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi that can cause infections. The Immune System is a complex network of cells, tissues and chemicals that fight against infections and kill micro-organisms when the latter invades the human body. This system is basically composed of White Blood Cells which are produced in the Bone Marrow. They are concentrated in the bloodstream, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract and other glands and organs within the human body. Causes of a Weakened Immunity: A weakened immunity refers to a state where the performance of the body's immune system is underactive or poor. A person with low immunity can increase the risk of infections & illnesses. A weakened immunity can be caused due to the following reasons: Stress: People under chronic stress are more susceptible to diseases & illnesses. Stress can increase the risk of other infections. It also delays the recovery process of an illness or injury. Poor Dietary Habits: Poor dietary habits can have a negative impact on the body's immune system. People who usually consume more junk food (that contain free calories in the form of excess sugar, fats like saturated fats, artificial colour, flavour, preservatives etc.) tend to have a weaker immune system. Psychological State: A poor psychological state has an adverse effect on the immunity of a human being. This state can lead to stress which compromises the immune system and makes it harder for it to fight against diseases. Smoking: The effects of tobacco smoke can decrease the levels of antioxidants present in the blood, which is responsible for increased susceptibility to infections and long-lasting illnesses. Sedentary Lifestyle: Jobs that involve sitting for long periods of time on a regular basis and avoiding exercises can affect the ability of the human body to fight infections. A sedentary lifestyle along with inactivity leads to an increased risk of an impaired immune system, inflammation and other chronic diseases. Poor Nutritional Status: Nutritional status of individuals is directly linked with the immune system. Poor nutrition can lead to an inadequate intake of energy and macronutrients (Carbohydrates, Protein & Fat) along with deficiencies of vital micronutrients (Vitamins & Minerals) which are important for proper functioning of the human body. So, the deficiencies of both macro & micronutrients resultin a weakened immunity of the body. Simple Ways to Boost Immunity: The body's immunity can be naturally boosted for it to function properly in the following ways: 1. Dietary Factors: Diet plays a significant role when it comes to strengthening the immune system. In an attempt to find ways to prevent infections, the first step should be providing the body with certain foods that may help to keep the body's immune response running strong. They are: Green Tea: Adding green tea to the daily diet may promote better immune responses by protecting the body against the damage caused by free radicals. Green Chilli: Green chillies are rich sources of antioxidants (like-Vitamin C) which help in strengthening the natural immunity of the body and in fighting diseases. Ginger: Ginger can enhance the protective functions of the immune system due to its anti- microbial properties. Garlic: Garlic can stimulate the immune response activity which destroys bacteria and viruses. Turmeric: A super spice, Turmeric, has high anti- oxidative properties that help to fight against free radical damage in the human body. Tomato: Tomatoes are a great source of Vitamin C and A. They play an integral part in boosting immune health. Lemon: Citrus fruits like Lemon are rich in Vitamin C which also play an important role in fighting against infections & ailments. Fresh Fruits & Vegetables: Fresh fruits & vegetables provide nutrients (like-Phytonutrients, Antioxidants, Fibres etc.) that promote a better immune response as well as healing and immune- modulating properties. Oats: The soluble fibres present in whole grains like oats help to reduce inflammation and boost the immune system. 2. Lifestyle Factors: Some lifestyle factors boost the immunity of the body. They are: Regular exercise • Adequate sleep Maintaining a balanced weight • Avoiding smoking & alcohol Proper hygiene maintenance • Meditation & yoga"

To lower the burden of diabetes, it is imperative to incorporate changes in lifestyle, such as regular exercise and dietary modifications that result in weight loss. Lifestyle interventions focusing on physical activity, healthy eating, and weight loss have shown to reduce the risk of developing diabetes by around 60%.  Who is at risk for diabetes? If you have one or more risk factors listed below, you are at a higher risk of developing diabetes: • Age 35 years or older • Have immediate family members with diabetes • Are overweight/obese (BMI 23 kg/m2) or a have a bigger waistline (males >90 cm, females >80 cm) • Have high blood pressure (hypertension) • Have high cholesterol • Have cardiovascular (heart) diseases • Were detected with prediabetes (HbA1C ≥ 5.7) • Have a sedentary lifestyle (walk less than 5000 steps/day) • Are a woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) • Are a woman at risk for gestational diabetes (2). How Can You Reduce The Risk of Diabetes? The following lifestyle modification tips can help reduce your risk of getting diabetes. 3) Exercise: Physical activity lowers the risk of diabetes by 20- 30%. Aim for 150 minutes/ week of moderate physical activity such as walking, cycling, or swimming or 75 minutes/ week of vigorous- intensity aerobics, with muscle training on two or more days of the week. (2). 4) Quit Smoking: Smokers are 30 to 40% more likely to develop diabetes than nonsmokers. Cigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals that eventually lead to an increased risk of developing diabetes. These chemicals also reduce insulin's effectiveness in lowering blood sugar levels. (5). 5) Limit Alcohol Excessive alcohol consumption reduces the body's sensitivity to insulin, resulting in diabetes. Alcohol also contains empty calories, which can add to your waistline and increase your sugar levels. (4). 6) Stop Sitting, Start Moving People who have a sedentary lifestyle (less than 5000 steps/day) are at a higher risk of developing diabetes. Being more active not only helps you lose weight, it also improves your cognitive skills and lowers the risk of other lifestyle diseases. (6). 7) Sleep More: Sleeping disturbances have also been linked to abnormal glucose metabolism, and have shown to significantly increase diabetes risk. Sleeplessness causes insulin-producing cells to stop working properly, which increases the risk of diabetes. (Z). 8) Stress Less: Stress releases hormones which can cause your blood sugar levels to rise. Stress also impacts the ability of insulin to work properly and thus, can lead to diabetes. (8). 9) Get some sunshine: Studies show that vitamin D deficiency may result in reduced insulin secretion. When vitamin D levels improve in the body, the functioning of insulin can also improve thus preventing the risk of diabetes. 10) Stay Hydrated: According to research, people who drink one sugary beverage a day have a 26% higher risk of developing diabetes than those who drink less than one per month. Switch to water, coconut water, buttermilk or green tea to keep you hydrated and lower the risk of obesity and diabetes."

It also diminishes clogging in the arteries by increasing good cholesterol. Studies have also shown its advantages in limiting the thickening of blood vessel walls, the first sign of heart disease. Promotes immunity Amla is a steady source of vitamins, antioxidants and contains tannins. Tannins, when coupled with polyphenols, makes the fruit a free radical scavenger. This means that it decreases the damage, free radicals cause to the cells and increases the body's disease-fighting ability. Reduces blood sugar Research has shown that fruits that are rich in polyphenol, protect the body from the oxidative nature of high blood sugar. Amla can thus be therapeutic for people who have diabetes. It also helps in the proper absorption of insulin in the body. In this manner, it decreases the blood sugar levels. Strengthens bones Osteoclasts are the cells accountable for breaking up bones. Amla's high calcium content and its ability to lower osteoclasts is the perfect combination that strengthens bones. So constant consumption of Amla is really good for the bones. Battles cancer As per research, the fruit has 18 compounds that inhibit the progress of gastric cancer, breast cancer and uterine cancer. Amla acts as a natural anti-mutagenic agent. Its chemopreventive properties are able to prevent the proliferation of tumour cells by killing them naturally while also building your immunity. Calcium absorption One of the less-discussed benefits of Amla is that it helps the body positively absorb calcium. Calcium is an essential component of our teeth, bones and nails. It also makes sure that one has lustrous hair. Amla is perfect for hair growth so, eating a Vitamin C-rich fruit like this is a great way to keep your body feeling as well as looking great! Ensures good dental health Amla is a powerful antimicrobial agent. Studies have found that different extracts of amla like methanol, hot and cold water, acetone and ethanol inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans bacteria. It had also been found that the acetone and hot and cold water extracts were effective against Staphylococcus aureus. So researchers suggest that amla can be beneficial as a treatment for tooth decay and cavities. Elixir for digestive problems Amla with lemon juice is a refreshing drink, beneficial in stopping acute bacillary dysentery. It pumps antioxidants into the body and keeps it hydrated. The antimicrobial properties of the fruit restore digestive health. The dried amla fruit can also be eaten for easing diarrhoea. So you see taking Amla or Amlaki can prove to be beneficial for our overall health. We can have it in the form of dry fruit or consume its powder form. Whichever we choose, it must be from a genuine source. Indulge in these dried Amla bites or stir up a lukewarm drink comprising of amlaki powder and honey for taste, to unlock the power of this nutrient powerhouse."

Understanding why it happens and how to deal with it can make all the difference. In this article, we'll explore the reasons behind those pesky tingling sensations and give you some easy tips to make them go away. So, let's dive in and find relief for that tingling feeling! What causes Tingling Sensations? Tingling sensations in the hands and legs can be due to various factors. Here are some common causes: Causes of Tingling Sensations in Hands and Feet: Nerve Damage or Compression Tingling sensations in the hands and feet can occur due to nerve compression or damage. Common causes include: a. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Compression of the median nerve in the wrist can lead to tingling, numbness, and pain in the hands. b. Herniated Discs: When discs in the spine become displaced, they can press on nerves, causing tingling sensations in the hands and feet. c. Peripheral Neuropathy: This condition involves nerve damage and can result from various causes, including diabetes, chemotherapy, alcohol abuse, and certain infections. Diabetes High blood sugar levels in diabetes can lead to nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy), resulting in tingling sensations in the hands and feet. Poor Circulation Reduced blood flow to the extremities can cause tingling sensations. Conditions such as peripheral artery disease, where arteries narrow and restrict blood flow, or Raynaud's disease, which causesspasms in blood vessels, can contribute to poor circulation and tingling sensations. Pregnancy Hormonal changes and increased pressure on nerves during pregnancy can lead to tingling sensations, particularly in the hands and feet. Sciatica Compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down to the legs, can cause tingling, numbness, and pain in the lower back, buttocks, and legs. Vitamin Deficiencies Deficiencies in vitamins such as B12, D, and E, as well as minerals like magnesium, can contribute to tingling sensations in the hands and feet. Infections: Certain infections, such as Lyme disease, HIV/AIDS, and shingles, can cause nerve damage and tingling sensations. Alcohol Abuse Excessive alcohol consumption can result in peripheral neuropathy, where nerves in the hands and feet are damaged, leading to tingling sensations. Other Medical Conditions: There are various other medical conditions that can cause tingling sensations in the hands and feet. These include: 1. Hypothyroidism: An underactive thyroid gland can affect nerve function and cause tingling sensations. 2. Multiple Sclerosis: This autoimmune condition can damage the protective covering of nerves, resulting in tingling, numbness, and other neurological symptoms in the hands and feet. 3. Fibromyalgia: A chronic pain disorder that affects the muscles and soft tissues, fibromyalgia can cause tingling sensations along with widespread pain. How to Stop Tingling Sensations? While addressing the underlying cause is essential, there are steps you can take to alleviate tingling sensations in the hands and legs. Here are some practical tips: 1. Improve Posture: Maintaining good posture can help relieve nerve compression. Use ergonomic furniture, take breaks, and avoid prolonged periods of sitting or standing to reduce pressure on nerves. 2. Exercise Regularly: Engaging in regular physical activity promotes circulation and helps alleviate tingling sensations. Incorporate aerobic exercises, strength training, and stretching into your routine to improve blood flow. 3.Eat a Balanced Diet: Proper nutrition is crucial for nerve health. Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Consider foods high in vitamin B12, vitamin D, and magnesium to address potential deficiencies. Consider multivitamin supplements if you are unable to substitute them in your diet. 4.Practice Stress Management: Stress and anxiety can contribute to tingling sensations. Engage in relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to reduce stress levels and promote overall well-being. 5. Apply Warm or Cold Compresses: Applying warm compresses can improve circulation, while cold compresses can help reduce swelling. Alternate between the two to find relief from tingling sensations. When to Worry and Seek Medical Attention? While most cases of tingling sensations are not a cause for immediate concern, there are situations where medical attention is warranted. Here are some indications to seek medical advice: 1. Persistent Tingling: If tingling sensations in the hands and legs persist for an extended period, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. 2. Accompanying Symptoms: Seek medical attention if tingling is accompanied by other concerning symptoms such as weakness, numbness, difficulty walking, loss of bladder or bowel control, or changes in vision. 3.Gradual Worsening: If tingling sensations gradually worsen over time or significantly impact your ability to perform daily activities, it is important to seek medical advice promptly. 4. Pre-existing Conditions: Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or thyroid disorders should be vigilant about any changes in tingling sensations and consult their healthcare provider accordingly. Tingling sensations in the hands and legs can stem from various causes, including nerve compression, poor circulation, nutritional deficiencies, and underlying medical conditions. By understanding these causes and implementing lifestyle changes, such as maintaining good posture, exercising regularly, and consuming a balanced diet, you can effectively manage tingling sensations.

[1] Heatstroke does cause sweating, but your skin may become hot, red, and dry. [4] Heatstroke is distinguished by high fever (104°F or higher), which if not rapidly reduced, affects the brain and leads to slurred speech, seizures, confusion, loss of consciousness, and movement coordination issues. How Can I Prevent Heatstroke? [3][4] Here are some tips that can help you prevent heat exhaustion and heatstroke: 1. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, throughout the day to stay hydrated.

Stay away from alcoholic and carbonated beverages. 2. Avoid strenuous activities during the hottest parts of the day. Engage in physical activities during cooler times of the day, such as the early morning or late evening. During workdays, take short breaks to rest or drink water. 3. Wear appropriate clothing. Wear clothes that are loose, light in color, and breathable to help you stay cool. Cover your head when going outside 4. Stay indoors: If possible, stay at home during the hottest parts of the day. Take baths to cool down; lie down under a fan or rest in an air- conditioned room, if available. Close windows and curtains during the day and leave them open at night to keep your home cool. 5. When going outside, use sunscreen with a high SPF (>30) to protect yourself from the sun's harmful rays. Wear long, loose-fitting clothes that cover your entire body. Use a hat or scarf to cover your head. Avoid the sun and rest in shade when necessary. 6. For children: Keep children cool and give them plenty of fluids. Never leave them alone in a car, even if the air conditioning is turned on and the windows are open. What should I do if someone has a heatstroke? Heatstroke is a medical emergency. If you suspect someone is suffering from heat stroke, seek medical attention immediately and call an ambulance. While you wait for the ambulance, try to bring their body temperature down. Here are some home remedies that may be useful: 1. If they are conscious, give them something cool to sip on. Water, coconut water, and sports drinks can help replenish fluid and electrolytes. 2. Lay them in a cool, shady place and remove any excess clothing. Spray or sponge them with cool water, wrap them in wet towels, and fan their damp skin. A cool shower or bath can help reduce the body temperature. 3. Apply a cool compress: Applying a cool compress, such as a damp towel, to your forehead, neck, and armpits can also help lower your body temperature.

Low Glycemic Index Moderation is vital when consuming kiwi, as it has a glycemic index of 50 and is considered suitable food for those with diabetes. Pair it with a balanced diet and consistent physical activity to maximise benefits. What’s more, kiwi has been shown to slowly release glucose into the bloodstream, making kiwis suitable for diabetics and individuals managing gestational diabetes. High Fibre content Kiwis are a fantastic source of soluble and insoluble fibre, making them a valuable addition to any diet. Their high water retention capacity also assists in the absorption and digestion of sugars from various foods. Moreover, studies indicate that incorporating fibrous foods can help regulate blood sugar levels, providing an added health benefit. Rich Source of Vitamin C Ensuring adequate Vitamin C intake promotes healthy tissue development and supports a robust immune system. Additionally, it has been shown to effectively mitigate the harmful effects of uncontrolled blood sugar levels by reducing inflammation. The production of collagen, essential for preventing diabetic dermopathy, is also boosted by Vitamin C. Since Kiwis are a rich source of this vital nutrient, incorporating them into one’s diet is a highly recommended strategy for maintaining optimal health. Blood clot prevention For individuals with diabetes, consuming kiwis can bring many advantages. These fruits are known to decrease the level of fat present in the bloodstream, which in turn helps to prevent the formation of dangerous blood clots. It is essential for those living with diabetes, as their elevated glucose levels can hinder the breakdown of these clots, potentially leading to an accumulation of plaque in the arteries. By incorporating kiwis into their diet, individuals with diabetes can cultivate a healthier lifestyle and reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Helps with blood pressure regulation Incorporating kiwis into your diet may be beneficial for maintaining healthy blood pressure levels and potentially preventing heart attacks and strokes. A recent study found that consuming three kiwis daily over eight weeks decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This effect could be attributed to lutein, an antioxidant in kiwis that may help regulate blood pressure. Kiwis’ high vitamin C content may contribute to these blood pressure-lowering effects. Consider adding this nutritious fruit to your meals as a simple way to support your cardiovascular health. Promote digestive health Kiwi is an excellent addition to your diet to improve your digestion. This fruit is packed with dietary fibre known to be beneficial for digestive health. In addition to its high fibre content, kiwi contains an enzyme called actinic which can effectively break down proteins in the gut. If you feel bloated after a heavy meal, consider eating a kiwi, as it can help break down proteins from meat and fish. It can ease discomfort and prevent bloating. Furthermore, kiwis are known to have a mild laxative effect which can help to stimulate a sluggish digestive system. So if you’re looking for a natural way to promote healthy digestion, incorporating kiwi into your diet is worth considering. Promote weight loss Kiwis are a great addition to a weight-loss diet. Their high water content and low-calorie count make them an excellent snack choice. Plus, they’re a great ingredient for breakfast smoothies. Vitamin C provides numerous health benefits, including regulating blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and gut health. The abundance of vitamin C in kiwis is essential for weight reduction. Suitable for skin health Collagen is vital in maintaining healthy skin and strong bones. It is necessary to consume enough collagen to support these vital functions of the body. Kiwi, a fruit rich in vitamin C, can aid in producing collagen within the body. By consuming kiwis regularly, you can help maintain the structure and hydration of your skin, keeping it healthy and glowing. Acne can be a frustrating and uncomfortable condition that affects many individuals. The anti-inflammatory properties and high vitamin C content in kiwis make them a natural remedy for reducing sebum production and inflammation in pores, which can help alleviate acne symptoms.

This simple and effective method can help nourish and rejuvenate your skin, leaving you feeling recharged and revitalised. Good for heart health Including various fruits and vegetables in your daily diet can significantly improve cardiovascular health. Recent research suggests that kiwis may offer particular benefits in reducing risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure. In a study of 118 individuals with high, average, or stage one high blood pressure, those who ate kiwis or apples experienced positive effects on their blood pressure. Of course, incorporating any fresh or frozen fruit into your diet can support your heart health, but kiwis are a tasty and effective option to consider. Reducing sugar absorption Consuming kiwi fruit is wise for people seeking to enhance their dietary fibre intake. The fruit’s fibre content aids in regulating blood sugar levels by slowing sugar absorption into the bloodstream, making kiwis good for diabetics. Furthermore, consuming fibre can positively impact digestive health and weight management, two crucial aspects for individuals with diabetes.

Here are a few preventive measures to be taken during the monsoon season: Remove stagnant water sources such as flower pots, old tires, and containers where mosquitoes can breed. Cover water storage containers tightly to prevent mosquitoes from accessing them. Apply mosquito repellent creams, lotions, or sprays containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin. Read the ingredient list on the label before applying it to your child. It is advisable to refrain from using products containing lemon eucalyptus oil or para-menthane-diol on children under 3. Use candles, and essential oils, with citronella, lemongrass, or plant them in our surroundings to naturally repel mosquitoes. Cover baby strollers and carriers with mosquito netting to protect your infant. Dress your child in clothing that covers their arms and legs before sending them out. Ensure that windows and doors have screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering the living spaces. Keep living spaces clean and clutter-free, as mosquitoes can hide in dark and damp areas. Properly dispose of waste and avoid creating conditions that attract mosquitoes. In the realm of dengue home remedies, these may provide relief and support during dengue fever. From the power of papaya leaf juice to the comforting qualities of ginger and honey, these remedies have been used for generations and passed down as precious wisdom. While these remedies hold significance, it is essential to remember that they are complementary measures, not substitutes for a medical opinion. If you experience a high fever, severe headache, joint pain, or rash symptoms, seek medical attention promptly. National Dengue Day serves as a reminder to unite in our efforts, raise awareness, implement preventive measures, and seek professional guidance. We can make a substantial impact by understanding the disease, maintaining a dengue-preventive diet, and actively participating in mosquito control efforts. These measures can reduce the incidence of dengue fever, promote a healthier environment, and safeguard the well-being of our loved ones."
